# React Job Portal – Routing Practice Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a hands-on demonstration of modern React routing techniques, built as a learning exercise to master client-side navigation using React Router. The application simulates a simple job portal, allowing users to browse job listings, view job details, and access contact information—all while showcasing best practices in React routing, nested layouts, and state/data management.

## 2. Features

- **Declarative Routing:** Utilizes `react-router-dom` v7+ for route definitions and navigation.
- **Nested Routes & Layouts:** Implements nested layouts for shared UI (e.g., navigation bar, section wrappers).
- **Dynamic Routing:** Supports dynamic job detail pages using route parameters.
- **Data Loaders:** Fetches data for routes using loader functions, demonstrating data-driven navigation.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error pages for invalid routes and data-fetching errors.
- **Navigation Components:** Interactive navigation bar with active link highlighting and programmatic navigation.
- **Component Organization:** Clear separation of concerns with pages, components, and layouts.

## 3. Technical Learning Outcomes

- **Understanding of React Router:** Gained practical experience with route configuration, nested routes, and dynamic segments.
- **Loader Functions:** Learned to fetch and inject data into routes using loader functions for better data management.
- **Layout Composition:** Mastered the use of layout components (`RootLayout`, `JobLayout`, `ContactLayout`) to provide consistent structure and shared UI.
- **Error Boundaries:** Implemented error elements for robust user experience during navigation failures.
- **State & Data Flow:** Explored how React Router manages state and data across different routes.
- **User Experience:** Enhanced navigation flow and responsiveness through client-side routing.

## 5. Routing Strategies

- **Root Layout:** All routes are nested under a `RootLayout` that provides the main navigation and page container.
- **Nested Layouts:** The `/jobs` and `/contact` routes use their own layouts for section-specific UI and further nested routes.
- **Dynamic Segments:** The `/jobs/:id` route displays job details based on the job ID.
- **Loader Functions:** Data for jobs and job details is fetched before rendering the respective components.
- **Fallback Route:** A catch-all route (`*`) displays a custom Not Found page for unmatched URLs.

## 6. State Management Approaches

- **Route Loaders:** Used for fetching and passing data to components via React Router's `useLoaderData`.
- **Component State:** Minimal local state, focusing on data-driven UI via routing.

## 7. Challenges Overcome

- **Nested Routing Complexity:** Learned to structure layouts and routes for maintainability and scalability.
- **Data Fetching in Routes:** Integrated loader functions to ensure data is available before rendering, improving user experience.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error boundaries to gracefully handle navigation and data errors.
- **Consistent Navigation:** Ensured navigation bar and active link states remain consistent across all routes.

## 8. How Routing Enhances User Experience

- **Seamless Navigation:** Users can move between pages without full reloads, resulting in a faster, smoother experience.
- **Deep Linking:** Direct links to job details or contact info are supported, improving shareability and accessibility.
- **Consistent Layouts:** Shared UI elements (like the navbar) persist across navigation, providing a cohesive look and feel.

## 9. Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jobportal
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or as indicated in your terminal).

4. **(Optional) Mock API**
   - The jobs data is fetched from `http://localhost:3000/jobs`.  
     You can use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) or a similar tool to mock this endpoint for local development.

## 10. Technologies Used

- **React** (v19+)
- **React Router DOM** (v7+)
- **Vite** (for fast development and HMR)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **ESLint** (for code quality)
